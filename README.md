# ACR-schema

This Github repository is supplied by GSA for the ACR VPAT Community in support submission of ACR VPATs. Here ACR developers can find the latest ACR policy Guidance and the API Schema specs that show the direction of ACR data architecture. The repositoryâ€™s aim is to provide real-time updates to the ACR API. It will serve as living documentation of the latest changes.

- As changes are made by IT Collect developers, the Open API spec will be automatically updated.
- Members of this repository receive alerts when files are updated, assuming they subscribe to GitHub notifications.
- A core team will monitor this repository for issues, questions and pull requests and will respond as issues and questions are raised and changes are proposed.

## ACR Documents

ACR How-To Guides and FAQ documents can be found in the [ACR Docs](https://github.com/GSA/ACR-schema/tree/main/ACR%20API%20Docs) folder in this repository. You can expect existing documents to be updated and new guides to be uploaded occasionally. We will communicate new document releases with the vendor community.
